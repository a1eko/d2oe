# d2oe

Neuronal data for D2-OE mouse model of schizophrenia according to Cazorla
*et al.*, 2012. Digital reconstructions of the striatal neurons from
Hjorth *et al.*, 2020 were adopted for the wild-type phenotype, see
directory `morphology/control/`. Dendritic morphology of the striatal
projection neurons was reduced to mimic progressive neurodegeneration,
as in `morphology/d2oe*/` for stages 0 through 20, using the Python
module [`treem`](<https://github.com/a1eko/treem>) v1.1.0, DOI:
[10.5281/zenodo.8265703](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8265703). Program
code for morphology processing can be found in the `scripts/` directory.

## Funding

The study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR-M-2020-01652),
